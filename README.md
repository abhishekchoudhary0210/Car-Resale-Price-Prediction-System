A modern Machine Learning application that predicts the resale price of a used car based on its specifications. Built using a **Random Forest Regression model** and deployed with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

## üìà Project Overview

This project aims to estimate the selling price of a used car based on various features such as:
- Mileage
- Engine Volume
- Brand and model
- Fuel type
- Purchased Year

The Random Forest model provides highly accurate predictions after extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values
- Converted categorical data (brand, model, fuel type) into numerical representations
- Standardized mileage and engine size into clean, usable numerical values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed price distributions across different brands
- Visualized the impact of:
  - Fuel type  on resale value
  - Car age on depreciation
  - Mileage influence on pricing trends

### 3. Model Building
- Trained a Linear Regression model as baseline
- Implemented Random Forest Regressor which outperformed other models
- Selected Random Forest as final model based on superior accuracy

### 4. Dashboard Development
Built a fully interactive dashboard using Streamlit with:
- Dynamic input fields (mileage, engine volume, brand, etc.)
- Real-time price prediction
- Clean, modern UI with custom styling

## üìä Key Features
- Real-time price estimation
- Support for 50+ car brands
- Mileage and age-based depreciation
- Clean, user-friendly interface
